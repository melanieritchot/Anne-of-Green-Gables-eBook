Anne of Green Gables was first published in 1908 and has since become a beloved classic of children's literature. The story follows the adventures of Anne Shirley, an 11-year-old orphan who is sent to live with a middle-aged brother and sister on their farm in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Anne is imaginative, talkative, and prone to mishaps, but she quickly wins over her new guardians and the people of the small town of Avonlea with her charm and good nature.
